# native_screenshot

Forked from https://gitlab.com/ivanjpg/native_screenshot.

This plugin aims to be a simple one that implements taking screenshot natively to capture scenes like camera preview or AR views. This cannot be done easily in plain Flutter, at least I cannot make it work using `RenderRepaintBoundary` and similar techniques.
